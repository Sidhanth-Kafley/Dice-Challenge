# Dice-Challenge

This is a dice game that I created using javascript and document object manipulation. The game has two players with one dice each and upon refreshing the web page each players rolls thier dice automatically and the winner(one with the higher value) is displayed.

You can use any IDE for javascript to run it.

Here is a link to the game: https://sidhanth-kafley.github.io/Dice-Challenge/
